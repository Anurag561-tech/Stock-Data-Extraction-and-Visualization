# Stock Data Extraction and Visualization Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on extracting stock market data and creating visualizations to analyze trends and performance of selected stocks over time. The project was developed as part of the **Skills Network** course and leverages tools like Python and Jupyter notebooks to manage data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

## Process

1. **Data Extraction**: 
    - Stock data was retrieved from an API or other online sources, formatted into a structured dataset for further analysis.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - The extracted data was cleaned and processed to ensure consistency. This step included handling missing data, formatting date columns, and ensuring the stock prices were aligned with the corresponding dates.

3. **Analysis**: 
    - Various metrics, such as moving averages, stock volume, and daily returns, were computed to gain insights into stock trends.

4. **Visualization**:
    - Matplotlib and other visualization libraries were used to generate charts and plots showcasing stock trends over time, highlighting critical points of change in stock value, volume fluctuations, and other metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how stock data can be effectively extracted and analyzed to derive insights using Python. The visualizations created provide a clear picture of stock performance, and further analysis can be done by integrating advanced models like moving averages, volatility measures, or predictive algorithms.
